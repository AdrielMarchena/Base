Hi :)

These are the premake files to build this libraries,
other libs are been handled in different ways (some are just build with Base it self).

To this:

	Add the submodules to these libs and paste the 'premake5.lua'
inside the folder of each lib, and when you run the premake5.lua on the
root if this repo, this guys will be included there, 
then you can build easily.

ps:
You can find and download premake5 here: https://premake.github.io/
