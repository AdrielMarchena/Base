# Base

Trying to be a Game Engine 
(for the most part, following The Cherno tutorials)

## Installation

I didn't work on this yet, but clone this, run on console:

```bash
vendor/bin/premake/premake5.exe vs2019
```

change 'vs2019' to your desired version

i'm using vcpkg for some libs, so you will need to enable vcpkg on your visual studio enable it manually, remember to put a 'yes' in:

```bash
Project Properties > vcpkg > 'Use Static Libraries'
```
## Dependencies

Are all listed on de 'Dependencies.lua' file

## Usage

The SandBox project is used to test things, and i probably will always leave that as a example as well

## Contributing
I only know the basic of git and github, when i learn more about this session, i change this text
